This directory contains J. Ritsema's fortran codes for extracting maps and cross sections from various tomography models, which 
can be found in the Models directory. The python script in here is set up to extract global depth sections every 10km, but can be modified to extract a section at some particular depth. The sections are output as .xyz files, which can then be converted into netcdf format for use with 
GMT or some other tool

To compile:

- Go to lib/libS20a and type 'Make'
- Go to src and type 'Make'

This requires gcc
